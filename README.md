🛡️ PhishGuard AI



AI-Driven Phishing Detection Chrome Extension



PhishGuard AI is a full-stack cybersecurity project designed to detect phishing threats in real time using a combination of AI-based analysis and rule-based security heuristics.

The system integrates a cloud-hosted FastAPI backend with a Chrome Extension (Manifest V3) that works reliably on modern, dynamic websites such as Gmail.



This project focuses on real-world security constraints, including browser sandboxing, CORS policies, and AI rate limits.



🚀 Key Capabilities



🔍 Real-time phishing risk analysis for active web pages



🤖 AI-powered URL inspection using Google Gemini



🧠 Rule-based fallback detection when AI is unavailable



📧 Gmail-compatible warning banner (SPA-aware)



☁️ Secure cloud backend deployed on Render



🔐 Server-side API key protection



📊 Scan history logging for analysis and debugging



🧱 System Architecture

Chrome Extension (Manifest V3)

&nbsp;├── content.js        → UI banner injection (Gmail-safe)

&nbsp;├── background.js     → Secure backend communication

&nbsp;└── manifest.json     → Permissions \& service worker

&nbsp;       |

&nbsp;       v

FastAPI Backend (Render Cloud)

&nbsp;├── Manual phishing heuristics

&nbsp;├── Google Gemini AI integration

&nbsp;├── History persistence

&nbsp;└── REST API endpoints



Design Rationale



Network requests are handled by a background service worker to bypass browser loopback and CORS restrictions



API keys remain fully isolated on the backend



Gmail’s dynamic DOM is handled using SPA-aware observers



🛠️ Technology Stack

Frontend (Chrome Extension)



JavaScript (Chrome Extension Manifest V3)



MutationObserver for SPA navigation



Secure message-passing architecture



Backend



Python + FastAPI



Google Gemini API



Requests, Pydantic



Cloud deployment via Render (Free Tier)



🌐 Deployed Backend



Base URL:



https://phishguard-backend-upyk.onrender.com



Available Endpoints



GET / – Service health check



POST /analyze – Analyze a URL for phishing risk



GET /history – Retrieve scan history



📦 Local Setup

Backend

cd backend

pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.py





Create a .env file:



GEMINI\_API\_KEY=your\_api\_key\_here

GEMINI\_MODEL=models/gemini-2.5-flash



Chrome Extension



Open chrome://extensions



Enable Developer Mode



Click Load unpacked



Select the extension/ directory



Visit any website or open Gmail to view alerts



🧪 Detection Methodology

Manual Heuristic Analysis



HTTPS enforcement checks



Suspicious top-level domains



IP-based URLs



URL length and obfuscation patterns



Brand impersonation indicators



AI-Based Analysis



Context-aware phishing classification



Risk scoring from 0–100



Human-readable explanation of verdict



If the AI service is temporarily unavailable, the system automatically falls back to manual detection logic.



⚠️ Known Limitations



Render free tier may introduce cold-start delays



Google Gemini free tier has daily request limits



Extension is not yet published on the Chrome Web Store



These limitations are documented intentionally to reflect real production constraints.



📈 Planned Enhancements



VirusTotal reputation integration



External link scanning inside email bodies



Chrome Web Store publication



Advanced threat intelligence feeds



User-level analytics dashboard
